# Packet Sniffer (Python + Scapy)

A simple and lightweight **network packet sniffer** built using **Python and Scapy**.  
It captures live TCP/UDP packets on your network and displays:

- Source IP address  
- Destination IP address  
- Protocol (TCP / UDP)  

This project is great for learning:
- Computer Networks  
- Packet analysis  
- Python socket programming  
- Network security basics
